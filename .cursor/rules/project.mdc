This project is a command-line tool built in golang. It is a simple currency converted tool, built with the following principles.

- Clean, well-architectureds and testable code
- The project uses direnv and devbox to setup isolated development environment. Any tool that is not a go dependency should be installed via devbox first. Any new terminal session should be run inside the development environment defined with devbox
- For every new feature, unit tests should be added
- At the end of every meaningful change or addition, the tests should be executer
- It relies on go's standard solutions instead of external libraries when possible
- When tests are changed or added, immediatelly run the test suite
